# Excel-Dashboard-Project
The project involved working with a dataset of bike sales, which included detailed customer information such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, region, age, and commute distance.


Project Tasks and Operations:


1.Data Cleaning:

-Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
-Replaced abbreviations with full forms for consistency.
-Changed data types where necessary to enable accurate analysis.
-Used IF & nested IF functions to categorize scattered data into meaningful ranges.
-Removed anomalies to standardize the dataset.

2. Dashboard Creation:

-Leveraged Pivot Tables for dynamic data analysis and made edits through value field settings.
-Applied slicers and established slicer connections for efficient filtering.
-Modified charts, utilizing clustered column charts, line charts, and line charts with markers for clear data visualization.
-Created a comprehensive sales dashboard.


Key findings from the analysis:

1. Income and Gender Dynamics:
Males with higher average incomes ($60,124) are more likely to purchase bikes compared to females ($55,774).
Potential strategy: Target high-income customers across genders with premium bike offerings.

2. Commute Distance Impact:
Highest number of bike purchases among customers with 0-1 mile commutes (200 purchases).
Idea: Market bikes as a convenient option for short urban commutes.

3. Age Group Preferences:
Middle-aged customers (31-54) dominate purchases (383) compared to adolescents (39) and older customers (59).
Opportunity: Tailor marketing and product designs to meet middle-aged customer needs.
